Cricket history is particularly murky and vague as to the exact origins of the 
game, it is believed to have been born in England in the late middle ages.Edward III banned a game similar to cricket in 1369, ‘pila baculorea’ or ‘club 
ball’ as it was known, as he saw it as being a distraction to his war effort.Derek Birley in his wonderful book, ‘A Social History of English Cricket’ 
suggests the game came to England with the French during the time of the Norman 
Invasion, that their word ‘criquet’ was the dialect name for a variation of club 
ball, the game Edward the III had sought to eradicate.There is record of the word ‘creag’ as a derivative of the word creaget in 
1299-1300 in the Royal Wardrobe Accounts, for the then Prince Edward the II to 
play ‘creag’ and other games.There is no evidence that creag was the same as criquet, the links are too 
tenuous and games rarely appear in any records of this time unless the 
aristocracy were playing them or trying to have them eradicated as being morally 
degenerate.</p>

Cricket is first recorded as a game played by schoolboys in Guildford in the 
sixteenth century and is found recorded in an Italian -English dictionary in 
1598.</p>

Gambling, the Aristocracy and Working Classes</h3>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1.75rem; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Exo, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;" class="auto-style3">
The game by 1611 was being played by adults, it is recorded that two men were 
prosecuted for playing cricket instead of attending church.On a similar theme, in 1628 ten men were fined for playing cricket rather than 
attending church service, they also had to make a confession to the congregation 
as way of penance.As the game continued to evolve amongst the working classes and the aristocracy, 
gambling became central to its growth.The aristocracy in particular, had seen in it, a game with the obvious 
attributes to bet on its outcomes. Teams were assembled under the patronage of 
Aristocrats and purses were put up for ‘great matches’.In 1696, ‘ a great match at Cricket was played in Sussex, they were eleven of a 
side, and they played for fifty guineas apiece’.The game had been growing both within the english upper classes and as a genuine 
recreational past time for rural workers in the southern counties of England.The composite teams that were beginning to be assembled for ‘great matches’ 
during this period of the early 1700’s, were crossing the class divides; as the 
purses played for encouraged the nobility that were patronizing the teams, to 
employ the best players that could be found.Thus, rural workers who had become adept at the game were being employed to play 
as ‘hands’ for the aristocracy and were travelling for their employ.At this time London, particularly North London, can lay claim to being the 
cradle of the game as matches staged in Islington at White Conduit Field had a 
‘field keeper’ for cricket and the Angel Inn as part of its amenities.In 1718 a match at White Conduit Field brought cricket into the law courts after 
a dispute between the two teams.The other area to lay claim to the ‘Cradle of Cricket’ was Hambledon in 
Hampshire, where the matches staged at the Broad Down of Halfpenny were where 
cricket began to ‘ assume that truly skilful and scientific character which it 
now possesses.’The men of Hambledon were immortalised in the writing of John Nyren, who 
captured the spirit of the club, its segregation between the classes and its 
rich and varied club life.The game continued to spread through England as the provincial towns grew with 
industrialization, with the first recorded game in Yorkshire played in the 
1750’s.</p>

By 1744 the Laws of Cricket had been codified and in 1788 the laws were revised 
by the <strong>Marylebone Cricket Club</strong>, they covered the length of the pitch, the 
distance between creases, wicket size, and ball weight.After 1760 the game saw the evolution of over arm bowling, replacing under arm 
bowling as the main way to deliver the ball. The game began to see the use of 
various lengths utilised by bowlers and the development of the craft of batting, 
as batters sought to respond to new bowling techniques.The ‘Straight Bat’ was introduced as part of this counter to new bowling 
techniques, the old bent ‘hockey stick’ style of bat went out of fashion.</p>

Cricket began to spread with Britains’ Imperialist ambitions, the Navy and Army 
were instrumental in its spread into the Colonies, with games being recorded in 
North America in the 1700’s.</p>

the United States. In 1868 an Australian Aboriginal side toured England and by 
1877 England played their first match against Australia to begin the games 
oldest rivalry.In 1882 England lost to Australia, a mock obituary was written for English 
cricket and two Melbourne ladies burnt a bail and presented it to the England 
cricket captain in an urn.Thus began the Ashes,the games longest running saga as the two sides play off 
every two years for the fabled urn.In 1889 South Africa became the third test nation.In 1900 cricket made its one and only appearance at the Olympics, England played 
France and won. Although interestingly, it looks as if cricket may be 
re-admitted to the Olympics in its shortest form, 20 20 cricket.By 1909 the Imperial Cricket Conference was formed to administrate the game, 
primarily from an English perspective, with England, South Africa and Australia 
being its founder members.India, the West Indies and New Zealand saw them become Test playing nations 
before the second WW, Pakistan joining after.Affiliate nations like Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, Zimababwe and Bangladesh have 
become Test playing nations toward the end of the twentieth century.</p>

Crises in Cricket</h3>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1.75rem; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Exo, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;" class="auto-style3">
The Twentieth Century saw major crises in cricket, initially in the bodyline 
series in 1932 -33 between Australia and England.Englands’ method of countering the genius of Don Bradman lead them to bowl to a 
leg side field with short pitched bowling. The Australians deemed this ‘not 
cricket’ and against the spirit of the game. It was an event of such proportions 
that Australia threatened to take political action they were so disturbed by it.Then in the 1970’s the D’Oliveira Affair blew South Africa from the 
international cricket stage for over twenty years, as they refused to receive 
the England team with the Cape Coloured Basil D’Oliveira in it.Its racist policies saw it cast into the wilderness only to return after the 
release of Nelson Mandela and the institution of multi racial cricket.The 1960’s and 70’s saw the introduction of single innings games, with the first 
class sides in England playing limited over cricket, these proved hugely popular 
and cricket saw its first One Day International in 1971 between England and 
Australia.In the mid 1970’s an Australian Media Mogul, Kerry Packer, bought up the worlds 
best cricketers and set up World Series Cricket, the players played in coloured 
clothing. Packer took on the cricket establishment in a legal battle for the 
right to host and televise games and won.World Series Cricket went a long way to professionalising the game in the 1970’s 
and allowing the players a living wage from their profession.</p>

Technology: Innovation or Invasion</h3>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1.75rem; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Exo, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;" class="auto-style3">
As the One Day game developed it brought with it some of the innovations from 
Tennis and American football, the use of technology to bring better decision 
making for umpires and to highlight areas of interest for the TV audience.Beginning with slow motion replays and specialist camera angles for Umpires, the 
game now has space age technology with ‘Stump Cams’,’Hot Spots’ and ‘Hawk Eye’, 
technology derived from modern warfare.Whether technology has improved the decison making of Umpires remains to be 
seen, there have been breakdowns in the application of technology and its lack 
of uniform roll out across all international games undermines its credibility.</p>
