England in the 1963 season in the form of a knockout cup contested by the 
first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was 
established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other major cricket 
countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, 
the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Limited overs cricket has 
seen various innovations including the use of multi-coloured kit and floodlit 
matches using a white ball.</span><br class="auto-style4" />

</strong><span><span class="auto-style7"><strong>A "one day match"</strong></span><span class="auto-style3"  >
<span class="auto-style7"  ><strong>:</strong></span><span class="auto-style4"> Named so because each match 
is scheduled for completion in a single day, is the most common form of limited 
overs cricket played on an international level. In practice, matches sometimes 
continue on a second day if they have been interrupted or postponed by bad 
weather. The main objective of a limited overs match is to produce a definite 
result and so a conventional draw is not possible, but matches can be undecided 
if the scores are tied or if bad weather prevents a result. Each team plays one 
innings only and faces a limited number of overs, usually a maximum of 50. The 
Cricket World Cup is held in one day format and the last World Cup in 2007 was 
won by Australia. The next World Cup will hosted by India, Bangladesh and Sri 
Lanka in 2011.</span></span></span></p>

<span class="auto-style7"  ><strong>:</strong></span><span class="auto-style4"> Is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being 
to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. 
The original idea,&nbsp; when the concept was in introduced&nbsp; England in 2003, was to 
provide workers with an evening entertainment. It has been commercially 
successful and has been adopted internationally. The inaugural&nbsp; Twenty20 World 
Championship was held in 2007 and won by India. 2009's Twenty20 World 
Championship was staged in England and won by Pakistan. After the inaugural ICC 
World Twenty20 many domestic&nbsp; Twenty20 leagues were born. First of them was 
Indian Cricket League which is considered as rebel league since it is 
unauthorized by BCCI and led to form an official league called the Indian 
Premier League.&nbsp; Both these leagues are cash rich and attracted players and 
audience around the globe. Recently Twenty20 Champions League was formed as a 
tournament for domestic clubs of various countries.</span><br class="auto-style4" />

England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the 
County Championship. The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th 
century but the official competition was not established until 1890. The most 
successful club has been Yorkshire County Cricket Club with 30 official titles.</span><br class="auto-style4" />
