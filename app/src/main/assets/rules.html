		<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">A cricket
		match is played between two teams of eleven players each on a&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn" title="Lawn"><span class="auto-style5">grassy</span></a></span>&nbsp;<span class="auto-style3"><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_field" title="Cricket field"><span class="auto-style5">field</span></a><span class="auto-style5">, 
		typically 137–150 metres (150–160 yd) in diameter.The Laws of Cricket do 
		not specify the size or shape of the field but it is often oval.A 
		cricket match is divided into periods called&nbsp;innings. During an innings 
		(innings&nbsp;ends with 's' in both singular and plural form), one 
		team&nbsp;fields&nbsp;and the other&nbsp;bats. The two teams switch between fielding 
		and batting after each innings. All eleven members of the fielding team 
		take the field, but only two members of the batting team (two&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsmen" title="Batsmen"><span class="auto-style5">batsmen</span></a><span class="auto-style5">) 
		are on the field at any given time.</span></span></span></p>

		<p class="auto-style9">
		<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">The key action 
		takes place in the&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch" title="Cricket pitch"><span class="auto-style5">pitch</span></a><span class="auto-style5">, 
		a rectangular strip in the centre of the field. The two batsmen face 
		each other at opposite ends of the pitch. The fielding team's eleven 
		members stand outside the pitch, spread out across the field.</span></span></span><span class="auto-style8">Behind 
		each batsman is a target called a&nbsp;wicket. One designated member of the 
		fielding team, called the&nbsp;bowler, is given a ball, and attempts to throw 
		(bowl) the ball from one end of the pitch to the wicket behind the 
		batsman on the other side of the pitch. The batsman tries to prevent the 
		ball from hitting the wicket by striking the ball with a bat. If the 
		bowler succeeds in hitting the wicket, or if the ball, after being 
		struck by the batsman, is caught by the fielding team before it touches 
		the ground, the batsman is&nbsp;dismissed. A dismissed batsman must leave the 
		field, to be replaced by another batsman from the batting team.</span></p>
	</div>
	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and the ball isn't 
		caught before it hits the ground, the two batsmen may then try to score 
		points (runs) for their team by running across the pitch, switching 
		positions. Each switch of positions is worth one run. The batsmen may 
		attempt multiple runs or they may attempt no runs. By attempting runs, 
		the batsmen risk dismissal, which can happen if the fielding team 
		retrieves the ball and hits a wicket with the ball before a batsman has 
		reached that end of the pitch.If the batsman hits the bowled ball over 
		the field boundary without the ball touching the field, the batting team 
		scores six runs and may not attempt more. If the ball touches the ground 
		and then reaches the boundary, the batting team scores four runs and may 
		not attempt more. When the batsmen have finished attempting their runs, 
		the ball is returned to the bowler to be bowled again. The bowler 
		continues to bowl toward the same wicket, regardless of any switch of 
		the batsmen's positions.After a bowler has bowled six times (an&nbsp;over), 
		another member of the fielding team is designated as the new bowler. The 
		new bowler bowls to the opposite wicket, and play continues. Fielding 
		team members may bowl multiple times during an innings, but may not bowl 
		two overs in succession.The innings is complete when 10 of the 11 
		members of the batting team have been dismissed or a set number of overs 
		has been played. The number of innings and the number of overs per 
		innings vary depending on the match.</p>

		match, which would otherwise be drawn.</span></span></span></p>

		<p class="auto-style9">The stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and so these must 
		be 22 yards (20&nbsp;m) apart. A bowling crease is 8&nbsp;feet 8&nbsp;inches (2.64&nbsp;m) 
		long with the middle stump placed dead centre. The popping crease has 
		the same length, is parallel to the bowling crease and is 4 feet (1.2&nbsp;m) 
		in front of the wicket. The return creases are perpendicular to the 
		other two; they are adjoined to the ends of the popping crease and are 
		drawn through the ends of the bowling crease to a length of at least 8 
		feet (2.4&nbsp;m).When bowling the ball, the bowler's back foot in his 
		"delivery stride" must land within the two return creases while his 
		front foot must land on or behind the popping crease. If the bowler 
		breaks this rule, the umpire calls "No ball".</p>
	</div>
	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">The importance of the popping crease to the batsman is that it marks the 
		limit of his safe territory for he can be stumped or run out (see 
		Dismissals below) if the wicket is broken while he is "out of his 
		ground".</p>

		<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">Off the field

		umpire</span></a><span class="auto-style5"> who can make decisions on

		mandatory under the playing conditions for Test matches and limited

		also have a&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_referee_(Cricket%2529" title="Match referee (Cricket)"><span class="auto-style5">match

		of cricket</span></a><span class="auto-style5">&nbsp;and the spirit of the

		recorded by two official&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorer" title="Scorer"><span class="auto-style5">scorers</span></a><span class="auto-style5">, 
		one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals 
		of an umpire. For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that 
		the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his 
		head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are 
		required by the Laws of cricket to record all runs scored, wickets taken 
		and overs bowled. In practice, they accumulate much additional data such 
		as bowling analyses and run rates.</span></span></span></p>
	</div>
	<h3><span><span id="Innings" class="auto-style6">Innings</span></span></h3>
	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the 
		term used for the collective performance of the batting side.In theory, 
		all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for 
		various reasons, an innings can end before they all do so.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">Depending on the type of match being played, each team has one or two 
		innings apiece. The term "innings" is also sometimes used to describe an 
		individual batsman's contribution ("he played a fine innings").The main 
		aim of the bowler, supported by his fielders, is to dismiss the batsman. 
		A batsman when dismissed is said to be "out" and that means he must 
		leave the field of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team. 
		When ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e., are out), then the whole 
		team is dismissed and the innings is over. The last batsman, the one who 
		has not been dismissed, is not allowed to continue alone as there must 
		always be two batsmen "in". This batsman is termed "not out".</p>
	</div>
	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">An innings can end early for three reasons: because the batting side's 
		captain has chosen to "declare" the innings closed (which is a tactical 
		decision), or because the batting side has achieved its target and won 
		the game, or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather 
		or running out of time. In each of these cases the team's innings ends 
		with two "not out" batsmen, unless the innings is declared closed at the 
		fall of a wicket and the next batsman has not joined in the play.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">In limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still "not out" 
		when the last of the allotted overs has been bowled.</p>
	</div>
	<h3><span><span id="Overs" class="auto-style6">Overs</span></span></h3>
	<div>
		<p class="auto-style9">
		<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">The bowler 
		bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or "balls") and each set of 
		six balls is called an&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket%2529" title="Over (cricket)"><span class="auto-style5">over</span></a><span class="auto-style5">. 
		This name came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls 
		have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other 
		end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not. A 
		bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can bowl 
		unchanged at the same end for several overs. The batsmen do not change 
		ends and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and 
		vice-versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at 
		square leg now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end 
		and&nbsp;vice-versa.</span></span></span></p>

		<p class="auto-style9">The bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a "run-up", although 
		some bowlers with a very slow delivery take no more than a couple of 
		steps before bowling. A fast bowler needs momentum and takes quite a 
		long run-up, running very fast as he does so.The fastest bowlers can 
		deliver the ball at a speed of over 90 miles per hour (140&nbsp;km/h) and 
		they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is 
		forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of 
		speed and guile. Some fast bowlers make use of the seam of the ball so 
		that it "curves" or "swings" in flight. This type of delivery can 
		deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball touches the 
		edge of the bat and can then be "caught behind" by the wicketkeeper or a 
		slip fielder.<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">At 
		the other end of the bowling scale is the "spinner" who bowls at a 
		relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the 
		batsman. A spinner will often "buy his wicket" by "tossing one up" (in a 
		slower, higher&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_trajectory" title="Parabolic trajectory"><span class="auto-style5">parabolic</span></a><span class="auto-style5">&nbsp;path) 
		to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very 
		wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted" or spun so that the 
		ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into 
		getting himself out.</span></span></span>In between the pacemen and the 
		spinners are the "medium pacers" who rely on persistent accuracy to try 
		and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's 
		concentration.<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">All 
		bowlers are classified according to their looks or style. The&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_bowlers_in_cricket" title="Types of bowlers in cricket"><span class="auto-style5">classifications</span></a><span class="auto-style5">, 
		as with much cricket terminology, can be very confusing. Hence, a bowler 
		could be classified as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as 
		LBG, meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are 
		called a "</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_break" title="Leg break"><span class="auto-style5">leg

		this is known as "throwing" or "chucking", and can be difficult to

		who operates behind the wicket being defended by the batsman on strike. 
		Wicket-keeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job 
		is to gather deliveries that the batsman does not hit, so that the 
		batsmen cannot run byes. He wears special gloves (he is the only fielder 
		allowed to do so), a box over the groin, and pads to cover his lower 
		legs. Owing to his position directly behind the striker, the

		<p class="auto-style9">At any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing area. One takes 
		station at the striker's end to defend the wicket as above and to score 
		runs if possible. His partner, the non-striker, is at the end where the 
		bowler is operating.<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">Batsmen 
		come in to bat in a&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket%2529" title="Batting order (cricket)"><span class="auto-style5">batting 
		order</span></a><span class="auto-style5">, decided by the team captain. 
		The first two batsmen – the "openers" – usually face the hostile bowling 
		from fresh fast bowlers with a new ball. The top batting positions are 
		usually given to the most competent batsmen in the team, and the 
		non-batsmen typically bat last. The pre-announced batting order is not 
		mandatory and when a wicket falls any player who has not yet batted may 
		be sent in next.</span></span></span>If a batsman "retires" (usually due 
		to injury) and cannot return, he is actually "not out" and his 
		retirement does not count as a dismissal, though in effect he has been 
		dismissed because his innings is over. Substitute batsmen are not 
		allowed.<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">A 
		skilled batsman can use a wide array of "shots" or "strokes" in both 
		defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to best effect 
		with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side 
		of the bat it is called an "</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(cricket%2529" title="Edge (cricket)"><span class="auto-style5">edge</span></a><span class="auto-style5">". 
		Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a 
		good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of 
		the wrists or by simply "blocking" the ball but directing it away from 
		fielders so that he has time to take a run.There is a wide variety of 
		shots played in cricket. The batsman's repertoire includes strokes named 
		according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., "</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cricket_terms#Cut" title="List of cricket terms"><span class="auto-style5">cut</span></a><span class="auto-style5">", 
		"drive", "hook", "pull".Note that a batsman does not have to play a shot 
		and can "leave" the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper, providing he 
		thinks it will not hit his wicket. Equally, he does not have to attempt 
		a run when he hits the ball with his bat. He can deliberately use his 
		leg to block the ball and thereby "pad it away" but this is risky 
		because of the&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket" title="Leg before wicket"><span class="auto-style5">leg

		carry their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score.</span></span></span><span class="auto-style8">More 
		than one run can be scored from a single hit; but, while hits worth one

		reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if 
		the ball touches the ground&nbsp;en route&nbsp;to the boundary or six runs if the

	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of "overthrows" 
		by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by 
		the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was 
		non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual 
		runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.The decision to attempt 
		a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the 
		ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: "yes", "no" and 
		"wait" are often heard.<span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">Running 
		is a calculated risk because if a fielder breaks the wicket with the 
		ball while the nearest batsman is out of his ground (i.e., he does not 
		have part of his body or bat in contact with the ground behind the 
		popping crease), the batsman is&nbsp;</span><a class="auto-style2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out" title="Run out"><span class="auto-style5">run 
		out</span></a><span class="auto-style5">.</span></span></span>A team's 
		score is reported in terms of the number of runs scored and the number 
		of batsmen that have been dismissed. For example, if five batsmen are 
		out and the team has scored 224 runs, they are said to have scored 224 
		for the loss of 5 wickets (commonly shortened to "224 for five" and 
		written 224/5 or, in Australia, "five for 224" and 5/224).</p>

		"sundries" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This

	</div>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p class="auto-style9"><span><span class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style5">No ball: a

		arm action</span></a><span class="auto-style5">; (b) overstepping the 
		popping crease; (c) having a foot outside the return crease. In 
		addition, the bowler has to re-bowl the ball. In limited overs matches, 
		a no ball is called if the bowling team's field setting fails to comply 
		with the restrictions. In shorter formats of the game (20–20, ODI) the 
		free hit rule has been introduced. The ball following a front foot 
		no-ball will be a free-hit for the batsman, whereby he is safe from 
		losing his wicket except for being run-out.</span></span></span></p>
		</li>
		<li class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">Wide: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by 
		the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; 
		as with a no ball, a wide must be re-bowled.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">Bye: extra(s) awarded if the batsman misses the 
		ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper to give the batsmen time to run 
		in the conventional way (note that one mark of a good wicketkeeper is

		</li>
		<li class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">Leg bye: extra(s) awarded if the ball hits the 
		batsman's body, but not his bat, while attempting a legitimate shot, and 
		it goes away from the fielders to give the batsmen time to run in the 
		conventional way.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">When the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide, his team incurs an 
		additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled 
		again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs 
		from this extra ball. The batsmen have to run (i.e., unless the ball 
		goes to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but these only 
		count towards the team total, not to the striker's individual total for 
		which runs must be scored off the bat.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="auto-style6">
		<p class="auto-style9">Before the umpire will award a dismissal and declare the batsman to be

		This is invariably done by asking (or shouting) the term "Howzat?" which 
		means, simply enough, "How is that?" If the umpire agrees with the 
		appeal, he will raise a forefinger and say "Out!". Otherwise he will 
		shake his head and say "Not out". Appeals are particularly loud when the 
		circumstances of the claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the
